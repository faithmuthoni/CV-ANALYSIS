The client needed a platform that seamlessly connected various listings platforms allowing shops to list their products to different platforms from a centralized point.
The needed functions developed were:
1. Ability members to pay a monthly subscription.
2. Inventory management ( add, edit and disable product)
3. Pushing the products to appropriate platforms ( For example car listings would be pushed to http://www.autobazaar.co.ke while property listings would be pushed to http://www.realestateonline.co.ke/
4. Pushing products to third party websites such as olx.co.ke without compromising on speed.
5. Ability for businesses to design their look and feel to suit their brand and the kind of listing.
For example:
http://toyopetauto.powerpage.co.ke and http://autobarn.powerpage.co.ke are
powerpage accounts selling cars but their look is different. On the other hand
http://propensityproperties.powerpage.co.ke account in for property listings

• Support and maintenance of existing system modules.
• Efficient development and integration of new features to the existing system.
• Performance tuning and monitoring of applications/systems.
• Perform backups across various systems.
• Documentation of developed modules
• User training&&July 2013 - Present (3 years 7 months);Mzoori Limited;Software Developer 
Mzoori is an on-line marketplace brings together Kenyan shoppers and sellers.
The platform allows sellers to list their products on the site and buyers to purchase, ask questions about any listed product or request for products which are not listed.
At the time, I joined the mzoori team the platform was a listings website and the client needed a way for shoppers to check out on-line. I was tasked with developing an eCommerce module for both the desktop and mobile platforms. This also involved creating a shipping calculators that catered for various carriers and retailers as well as integrating with various payment gateways available in Kenya.
With Kenya just taking up on-line shopping we only realised a 10% conversion upon launching the eCommerce module. I worked with the customer care department to run usability tests, user satisfaction surveys and A/B tests. After implementing our findings we saw the conversion rates rise from 10% to 30%
and a drop in bounce rates.
Beside the eCommerce platform, each individual customer's action on the site was tracked and their action presented to the relevant team in an understandable format such that any employee could attend to any
customer issue with the customer's habits at the fingertips. This allowed the customer care team to easily connect with customers who had abandoned shopping carts and the marketing team could create newsletters
based on what people were interested in.
Among others I also worked on a newsletter subscription module, creating back end reports on sales, revenue, user behavior and commission calculations among others.I also worked with the other team members to ensure a smooth transition between various versions of the website.

2. Managing inventory for both autobazaar and realestate from powerpage
3. Ability to automatically map a website to a powerpage account upon request by client.
4. Ability for businesses to design their look and feel to suit their brand and the kind of listing.

also incorporates a mechanism of crowd sourcing information from the various

Farmpreneur – www.shambaplus.xyz
An online decision support system that harnesses the power of data mining
and machine learning to do some analysis on relevant data such as weather
forecasts, price and demand expectations that affects the decision on what to
grow for a maximum return. The system also incorporates the concept of
future markets by including a marketplace of maturing farm commodities and
close proximity linking of farmers and prospecting buyers.
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the award of the
degree of computer science at the University of Nairobi. Due to the potential
value it could add to the agricultural sector and to farmers, it was selected for
the Nairobi International Trade Fair 2016 and showcased during the event.
Further work is ongoing that is aimed at transforming this project into an
application with real world use and a viable commercial venture (ShambaPlus).

Supply Chain Hierarchy Tool – http://41.89.93.232/supply-pipeline/
The purpose of this project was to establish a hierarchy of the drugs supply
chain that is not captured in DHIS2 – Kenya national health reporting system –
for purposes of analysis and report generation.
As things stand, the Kenya instance of DHIS2 only establishes a hierarchy based
on the country’s administrative units (national, county, sub-county, facility),
which while important, does not capture the supply chain hierarchy for ART-
related medicines & nutrition commodities. This supply hierarchy needs to
place facilities in their correct order matching the flow of both data/information and health commodities; hence clearly showing the reporting chain i.e. what facilities report to which others, and what facilities report to the national/central level (NASCOP), hence instituting a parent-child relationship.
